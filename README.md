# Node API for Word Guessr ðŸŽ®

This repository contains the Node.js backend API for Word Guessr, a simple word guessing game. The backend is designed to handle game logic such as creating new games, tracking game state, and managing guesses. A [React repository](https://github.com/MMcBreezy/word-guessr-react) is available for the frontend UI.

## Features

- Create a new game
- Get the state of a specific game by ID
- Make a guess in a game
- Stateless server design using a simple in-memory database

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/word-guessr-api.git
cd word-guessr-api
npm install
npm start
```

## Usage

### Create a New Game

Send a POST request to /game.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/game
```

You will get a JSON response with the game's current state.

### Get Game State

Send a GET request to /game/:id, replacing \:id with the game's ID.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/game/YOUR_GAME_ID
```

### Make a Guess

Send a POST request to /game/:id/guess with a single alphanumeric guess parameter, replacing \:id with the game's ID.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"guess": "A"}' http://localhost:3001/game/YOUR_GAME_ID/guess

```

The guess should be a single alphanumeric character. You'll get a JSON response indicating the game's current state.

Example of a JSON object of a completed game state:

```json
{
  "id": "37a8a959-b2ca-4c89-ba52-deea7cfdfe08",
  "letters": [null, null, "'a'", null, "'n'", null, null],
  "guesses": ["'a'", "'d'", "'e'", "'f'", "'n'", "'r'", "'s'", "'t'"],
  "guessesRemaining": 0,
  "userWon": false,
  "userLost": true,
  "userFinished": true,
  "revealedWord": "'plainly'"
}
```

## Architecture

### Game Class

Handles the logic for individual games, including managing guesses and tracking state.

### Memory Class

A simple in-memory database that stores game states.

### Word Helper

Provides random words for the game. This component reads from a list of words stored in a .txt file and returns a random word when needed for a new game.

Future Plans ðŸŒŸ
We are excited to share that we are planning on integrating OpenAI's API as the source for random words. This will add a layer of complexity and variety to the game. If you're interested in this feature, keep an eye on the openai-api branch for the latest updates!
