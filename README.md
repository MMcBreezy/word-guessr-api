## Usage

### Create a New Game

To create a new game, send a POST request to `/game`.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/game
```

You will get a JSON response with the game's current state.

### Get Game State

To get the state of a game, send a GET request to `/game/:id`.

Replace `:id` with the game's ID.

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/game/YOUR_GAME_ID
```

### Make a Guess

To make a guess, send a POST request to `/game/:id/guess` with the `guess` parameter.

Replace `:id` with the game's ID.

```bash
curl -X POST -d "guess=A" http://localhost:3000/game/YOUR_GAME_ID/guess
```

The guess should be a single alphanumeric character. You'll get a JSON response indicating the game's current state.
